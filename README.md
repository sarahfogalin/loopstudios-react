## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned the best approach with responsive design is mobile first! Coming from building only mobile applications - for example, React Native - to responsive web apps, I really enjoyed the challenge of making an app both web and mobile friendly. I loved putting this design together and
am very happy with the results. 

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to be able to improve my skills regarding responsive design best practices. Additionally I would love to learn more about different styling tools such as Sass and Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive design in React](https://itnext.io/3-ways-to-implement-responsive-design-in-your-react-app-bcb6ee7eb424) - This helped me to decide the best choice for responsive design with React.
- [Overlap Images in CSS](https://bricampgomez.com/blog/how-to-overlap-images-in-css/) - This was a great article that helped me with finding the right method to overlap content.
